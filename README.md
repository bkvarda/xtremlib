# xtremlib
 
xtremlib is a PowerShell Module that acts as a wrapper for interactions with the XtremIO RESTful API
This is currently incomplete, I intend to include most API functionality as well as make content more presentable
 
## Installation

### Importing the Module 
Download xtremlib.ps1 and copy to a PowerShell module directory. If you do not know where your PowerShell module directories are, 
open up a PowerShell prompt and examine the PSModulePath variable by entering '$env:PSModulePath'. Once the file has been placed in 
a module directory, run 'Import-Module xtremlib.ps1' in PowerShell.

### Installing the Module
Instructions will be provided once manifest is created
